<strong>2.2.</strong> The Terms of use do not apply to the Third-Party Services to which the User gains access by using the Services.<br />
<strong>2.3.</strong> All deviations from and amendments to these Terms of use are only binding to Keyn if and in so far as they have been explicitly agreed in writing and in so far as Keyn has been represented by an officer who is duly authorised by virtue of Keyn’s Articles of Association.

<strong>2.5.</strong> If one or more provisions of these Terms of use prove null and void or must be voided, the other provisions of these Terms of use will remain in full force.<br />
<strong>2.6.</strong> Keyn reserves the right to unilaterally amend the contents of these Terms of use at its discretion. The amended version applies as soon as Keyn has sent the User an electronic notification of the change and the User has not objected to its applicability within thirty (30) days of transmission of this notification. The most recent version of these Terms of use applies to all contracts entered into afterwards and in all situations in which various versions can be deemed applicable.<br />
<strong>2.7.</strong> As regards any elements that have not been provided for in these Terms of use, the contents thereof will be determined by the offer, the acceptance thereof by the User or the acceptance thereof by Keyn, all in so far as explicitly occurred and in so far as they do not conflict with each other.<br />
<strong>2.8.</strong> Headings in these Terms of use have been added for clarification purposes only and therefore do not affect the content or interpretation of any provision of these Terms of use.<br />
<strong>2.9.</strong> These Terms of use will be made available in various languages. In the event of any dispute with respect to the contents or interpretation of these Terms of use, the <a href="{{%20dutch_terms%20}}">Dutch text</a> will be binding.<br />
<strong>2.10.</strong> In the event that a contract between the Parties is or has been terminated, irrespective of the reason, the provisions of these Terms of use that by their nature or contents are intended to endure beyond the termination of this contract, will remain in full force after the termination including, but not limited to, the provisions on termination, cancellation, confidentiality, amounts owed to Keyn, general use of the Website, disputes with Keyn and general provisions.</p>

<h4 id="article-3formation-and-amendment-of-the-contract">ARTICLE 3:	FORMATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE CONTRACT</h4>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> A Distance Contract between the Parties is formed as soon as the User downloads and/or uses the Application, or as soon as the User uses Keyn’s Services in any other manner, or if Keyn performs any other activities that follow naturally from the current contract and the User does not object on the same day.<br />
<strong>3.2.</strong> Amendments to this Distance Contract are only binding to Keyn if and in so far as they have been explicitly agreed in writing and in so far as Keyn has been represented in this by an officer who is duly authorised by virtue of Keyn’s Articles of Association. Such deviations do not have any binding effect on other contracts/legal acts between Keyn and the User.</p>

<h4 id="article-4use-of-keyn">ARTICLE 4:	USE OF KEYN</h4>

<p><strong>4.1.</strong> The User can only use the Services in so far as the User has the appropriate or necessary equipment, including, but not limited to, a smartphone or tablet, as well as access to internet, e.g. (without limitation) by means of a subscription at a telecommunications service.<br />
<strong>4.2.</strong> As soon as the Mobile Application is installed, the latter will generate a unique and random Random Seed. The User’s passwords will be derived from this Random Seed. The Random Seed can be represented as twelve (12) words (‘Paper Back-up’).<br />
<strong>4.3.</strong> The User is responsible for the safekeeping of their Paper Back-up. Keyn does not accept any liability for this in any way.<br />
<strong>4.4.</strong> The User agrees that Keyn can contact them via push notifications. The User can disable Keyn’s push notifications at any time through the Mobile Application as well as through the equipment used by the User.<br />
<strong>4.5.</strong> The User’s passwords are only stored on the User’s smartphone or tablet. Keyn has no access to the User’s passwords. Keyn is in no way able to restore or retrieve the User’s secured data. The User can restore or retrieve their secured data themselves by means of their Paper Back-up.<br />
<strong>4.6.</strong> In order to restore an account by means of the Paper Back-up, Keyn will store the following User data: (i) websites at which the User has an account; (ii) the User’s user names; and (iii) other configuration data. These data are encrypted and are not accessible to Keyn.<br />
<strong>4.7.</strong> The Application and the Website may not be used for any other purposes than the purposes for which they have been made available to the User. Therefore, the User is not allowed to change, edit, hack, translate, copy, disseminate, pledge, transmit, exploit, encumber, crack or otherwise modify (any part of) the Application or the Website. The User is also prohibited from reproducing, licensing or distributing (any part of) the Application or the Website.<br />
<strong>4.8.</strong> Keyn has the right to modify or delete the contents of the Application and/or the Website at its own discretion and/or to refuse Users (partial or temporary) access to the Application and/or the Website.<br />
<strong>4.9.</strong> The functionality to scan QR codes with the Mobile Application may only be used to scan those QR codes that have been generated by the Extension.<br />
<strong>4.10.</strong> The User uses the Applications, the Services and the Website at their own risk. The User is obliged to familiarize themselves with and is deemed to understand the risks associated with the Application, the Services and the Website.</p>

<h4 id="article-5prices">ARTICLE 5:	PRICES</h4>

<p><strong>5.1.</strong> Keyn offers the User two versions:<br />
<strong>a.</strong> a free version, which is functional, but limited to only eight (8) accounts (‘free version’); or <br />
<strong>b.</strong> a paid version, with an unlimited number of accounts (‘Subscription’).<br />
<strong>5.2.</strong> Users who take out a subscription have the right to terminate the Subscription during the first fourteen (14) days without giving any reasons. The cooling-off period will commence on the date that the User takes out the Subscription.<br />
<strong>5.3.</strong> All amounts that the User owes to Keyn for the Subscription must be paid by the User to Keyn in advance. The User will be invoiced recurrently and periodically. Keyn offers two possibilities: annual and monthly payment.<br />
<strong>5.4.</strong> All costs and prices quoted by Keyn or agreed between the Parties, and all statements in that respect, are non-binding and can be changed by Keyn with the User’s prior written approval at any time.<br />
<strong>5.5.</strong> All costs and prices quoted by Keyn or agreed between the Parties are denominated in the currency of the User’s country of residence and, therefore, should be paid to Keyn in that same currency unless Keyn has explicitly stated otherwise in writing.<br />
<strong>5.6.</strong> All costs and prices quoted by Keyn or agreed between the Parties are inclusive of VAT, government levies, insurances, transaction costs as well as other duties and expenses.<br />
<strong>5.7.</strong> At the end of each period, the Subscription will be renewed automatically under the same conditions and against the then applicable rates. After the automatic renewal of the Subscription, the User has the right to terminate the Subscription subject to a notification period of one month.</p>

<h4 id="article-6payment">ARTICLE 6:	PAYMENT</h4>

<p><strong>6.1.</strong> In the event of a Subscription, the User must pay the prices, costs and other amounts owed to Keyn through the App Store. The availability of the relevant payment method depends on various factors, such as the User’s location and the User’s bank. Therefore, Keyn cannot guarantee the proper functioning of the payment method and can never be held liable for any damage resulting from the payment method.<br />
<strong>6.2.</strong> In the event that the User has not paid within the payment term determined by Keyn, the User is legally in default without any prior notice of default being required. <br />
<strong>6.3.</strong> Any complaints about the prices and costs charged to the User can be lodged with Keyn in writing within fourteen (14) days after the relevant amounts have been paid by the User to Keyn or after the invoice date, such at the risk of forfeiting all rights.<br />
<strong>6.4.</strong> In the event that the User defaults on the (timely) fulfilment of their (payment) obligations, all reasonable costs incurred to obtain an out-of-court settlement are at the User’s expense. In any event, the User will owe Keyn the incurred collection costs in the event of a money claim. The amount of the collection costs is calculated in conformity with the Dutch Extrajudicial Collection Costs (Standards) Act (‘Wet Normering Buitengerechtelijke Incassokosten’) with a minimum amount of €40 (exclusive of VAT). Any reasonable legal and execution costs will also be at the User’s expense.<br />
<strong>6.5.</strong> Payments made by the User will initially serve to pay all interest and costs due, and subsequently to settle the longest outstanding invoices, even if the User states that the payment is for a later invoice.<br />
<strong>6.6.</strong> Keyn is entitled at all times to demand that a (proprietary) security be provided by the User for the fulfilment of the User’s (payment) obligations under the contract.<br />
<strong>6.7.</strong> The full action for payment is immediately due and payable if:<br />
<strong>a.</strong> a payment term has been exceeded;<br />
<strong>b.</strong> the User applies for a moratorium or has been granted a statutory debt adjustment;<br />
<strong>c.</strong> the User’s property or receivables are seized;<br />
<strong>d.</strong> the User is placed under guardianship or deceases.</p>

<h4 id="article-7confidentiality">ARTICLE 7:	CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>

<p><strong>7.1.</strong> All information that is confidential in the opinion of Keyn and that the User obtains regarding Keyn and its Services, as well as all information the User obtains regarding third-party users, must be kept confidential and can only be used in relation to the Services.</p>

<h4 id="article-8user-and-security">ARTICLE 8:	USER AND SECURITY</h4>

<p><strong>8.1.</strong> The User has full responsibility for protecting and operating the electronic equipment on which they have downloaded the Application or, as the case may be, with which User makes use of the Services. The User is held to protect their equipment adequately, including, without limitation, by not interrupting the security of the operating system, as well as by periodically monitoring and updating it.<br />

<strong>8.3.</strong> The User should make all reasonable efforts to prevent the loss, theft or misuse of the equipment referred to in #### Article 8(1) as well as their Paper back-up. The User is aware of the risk arising from the loss, theft or misuse of the relevant equipment or their Paper Back-up, including, but not limited to, the risk that a third party may gain (illegal) access to the User’s passwords.<br />
<strong>8.4.</strong> The User is not allowed to disclose their Paper Back-up to any third parties, including employees of Keyn. If the User loses or forgets their Paper Back-up, Keyn cannot provide any help to recover the User’s accounts.<br />
<strong>8.5.</strong> If the User has any suspicion that their Paper back-up is being used by a third party, or has been misused and/or impaired, the User must notify Keyn of this suspicion as quickly as possible in writing.</p>

<h4 id="article-9liability-of-keyn">ARTICLE 9:	LIABILITY OF KEYN</h4>

<p><strong>9.1.</strong> The limitation of Keyn’s liability in conformity with the provisions of this #### Article 9 only applies in so far as permitted by the law.

In addition, the User accepts that Keyn has the right to recover damage from the User if the latter has used the Application or Website for illegal purposes, in an illegal manner or in any other manner contrary to these Terms of use. Such damage may relate to direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damage.<br />
<strong>9.7.</strong> The User will compensate Keyn for all damage and costs arising from or relating to any breach by the User of the contract (Terms of use) between the Parties, any unlawful act by the User towards Keyn or any other claims that Keyn may have against the User on the basis of the applicable laws and/or regulations.</p>

<h4 id="article-10-intellectual-property">ARTICLE 10: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

<p><strong>10.1.</strong> Subject to the provisions of the Terms of use, Keyn grants the User a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable license to use the Application, the Services and all related contents, materials and information solely for purposes approved by Keyn and in accordance with the applicable laws and/or regulations.
